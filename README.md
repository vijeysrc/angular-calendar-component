# Angular Calendar Component

**A light weight Angular Calendar component**

>A very simple and light weight calendar component developed using AngularJs.

>The widget just displays a calendar with navigation controls.

>This can be used if you don't want a bloated calendar widget with too many features.

>It uses the [Calendar Service](http://github.com/vijeysrc/calendar-service) which provides all the logic it needs.

## Installation

```
bower install vijeysrc/angular-calendar-component
```


## Basic usage

> Once installed, the component is available with the `vj.calendar` module.
